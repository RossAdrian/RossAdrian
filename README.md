Hey there 👋!

I like coding, specializing in languages like C++, Python🐍, and everything in between. When I'm not battling bugs or crafting complex algorithms, I drink my Java coffee ☕️ and think about my next cool projects.

I like to overcome any challenge that comes before me. From debugging nightmares to performance optimization, I'm here to turn your coding problems into features!
Whether you're a programming newbie looking for guidance or an experienced developer looking for a little more challenge, I'm here to help.

These are my skills 😊:

* Java backend programming (Yes, that coffee I drink as well)
* Scripting with Python, Bash and JavaScript
* Web-frontend development with JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, CSS and HTML (Most time *Thinking in React*)
* Native speaking C, C++ and some obscure assembler dialects 👾
* Embedded application and operating system development 📟
* Linux administration 🐧 (As like Darth Vader would say, *I am your sudoer*)
* Debugging and testing (Think it's not a secret that *programmers spend more time debugging then writing code*)
